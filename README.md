# AutoCertification

This is a google apps script code that can automate the generation of certifications upon a google forms submission based on score.
Generating certifications for those who passed a quiz manually can be quite tasking and time-consuming. This process can be easily automated by hosting the quiz on google forms and automatically generate certifications that are directly sent to the user upon submission. Here is what you need to create in preperation:
1. Create a google slide with the desired template of the certification. **This is where you will insert your script into google apps script.**
2. Create a google doc that will contain the content of email body 
3. Create the google forms with quiz questions and access its associated google sheets.


Notes:

-When you first run the script it will require you to sign in to your google account for access, you will get a "google haven't verified this app" warning,
but just click on advanced and continue signing in. This will only occur the first time you run the script.

-You need to run the trigger function and make sure it works well

-You need to enable the google slides API by adding it through the Services tab.
